Oxide Launcher is a custom launcher for Minecraft built with rust and tauri.<br />
It allows you to easily manage and install mods for multiple different installations of the game.<br />
<br />This launcher is heavily inspired by Prism Launcher but we are <b>Neither</b> endorsed by or a fork of it. 

## Installation

All of our latest builds can be found in the releases tab.

>[!NOTE]
>We do not <b>currently</b> have a website, but as we get further into development we >expect to eventually launch one with downloads and instructions hosted there. 

### In-Development Builds

 In this projects current state, assume every build is a developer build. 

>[!WARNING] 
>We do NOT recommend that the average user downloads Oxide yet. 

## Community

We are working on creating a community discord server and a subreddit soon, but it is rather low on our list of priorities. Feel free to make one yourself. 

## Building From Source
