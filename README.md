Oxide Launcher is a custom launcher for Minecraft built with rust and tauri.<br />
It allows you to easily manage and install mods for multiple different installations of the game.<br />
<br />This launcher is heavily inspired by Prism Launcher but we are <b>Neither</b> endorsed by or a fork of it. 

## Installation

All of our latest builds can be found in the releases tab.

>[!NOTE]
>We do not <b>currently</b> have a website, but as we get further into development we expect to eventually launch one with downloads and instructions hosted there. 

## Building from source

### Windows

cd "E:\Projects\OxideLauncher\app"
cargo tauri build --no-bundle

### Linux

cd "$HOME/Projects/OxideLauncher/app"
cargo tauri build --no-bundle

<br />

>[!WARNING] 
>Development is actively happening on a windows machine. Linux support is untested and experimental. 

## Community

We are working on creating a community discord server and a subreddit soon, but it is rather low on our list of priorities. Feel free to make one yourself. 

## License 

All launcher-related code in this repository is licensed under the GPL-3.0-only license.
